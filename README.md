# Aloha Project

## Summary: 
Aloha project is the first project from the front-end web development program at Red Academy. 
The project is built from what I have learned through the first 2 weeks into the program, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery. This is my first website that I ever built. There were and still are some difficulties learning and using the new languages, but it has been a fun experience and can't wait to tackle on new projects.
